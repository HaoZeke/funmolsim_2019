# About FunMolSim 2019
Molecular simulation is a powerful tool to investigate the thermodynamic and
transport properties of a variety of systems. A wide class of scientific
phenomena can be explored and understood from a molecular level. The advances in
computing technology have also enabled us to solve a wide range of complex
problems. The objective of this workshop is to expose the students and
researchers to various molecular simulation techniques with special emphasis on
engineering applications. The school particularly is targeted for graduate
students, post-doctoral students, young lecturers, and assistant professors. The
lectures will enable the participants to learn the fundamental concepts of
molecular simulations and its applications in solving a wide range of
engineering problems.

 
The following topics will be covered in the workshop:

1. Introduction to statistical mechanics, statistical ensembles, intermolecular potentials
2. Basics of molecular dynamics simulations, the extension to various ensembles.
3. Introduction to Monte Carlo simulations
4. Efficient calculation of phase equilibria of pure fluids and mixtures using Gibbs ensemble and extended ensemble simulations
5. Transition Matrix Monte Carlo simulation for phase diagram, GCMC simulation for adsorption/desorption of gases/liquid in porous materials.
6. Advanced free-energy methods, umbrella sampling, metadynamics
7. Coarse-graining methods for soft matter simulations
8. Introduction to DPD and Brownian dynamics simulations 
9. Extensive tutorials on writing molecular simulation codes
10. Hands-on experience on molecular simulations s/w such as GROMACS, LAMMPS, TOWHEE

<!-- ## What are Molecular Dynamics? -->
<!-- [Molecular -->
<!-- dynamics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Molecular_Simulation/Molecular_Dynamics) -->
<!-- simulations are a tool to simulate the motions of atoms of a many-body system. -->
<!-- Molecular dynamics may be used to compute the equilibrium and transport -->
<!-- properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, diffusion, reaction rate, protein -->
<!-- folding time, structure and surface coating) of a classical system. To simulate -->
<!-- the dynamics of molecules, classical Newtonian mechanics can be used. In -->
<!-- practice, molecular dynamics simulations are performed by moving in small -->
<!-- increments of time. It is the solution of the classical equations of motion for -->
<!-- atoms and molecules to obtain the evolution of a system. Because molecular -->
<!-- systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to -->
<!-- determine the properties of such complex systems analytically, so MD is applied -->
<!-- to these systems to solve this problem by using numerical methods. -->
