# About FunMolSim 2019

Molecular simulation is a powerful tool to investigate the thermodynamic and
transport properties of a variety of systems. A broad class of scientific
phenomena can be explored and understood from a molecular level and is also
reflected in the increased number of publications in this area, by many folds,
in recent years. The advances in computing technology, on the other hand, have
also enabled us to solve a wide range of complex problems. 

The objective of this workshop is to expose the students and researchers to
various molecular simulation techniques with particular emphasis on engineering
applications. The workshop mainly is targeted for assistant professors, PhD
Scholars, Post-doctoral fellows and master students. The lectures will enable
the participants to learn the fundamental concepts of molecular simulations and
its applications in solving a wide range of engineering problems.


This QIP course on Fundamentals of Molecular Simulations is aimed at sharing the
pedagogical and research procedures employed at different IITs and IISc. The
workshop comprising of lectures and lab session shall give the participants of
learning, teaching and doing research and development and hopefully aid them in
establishing a similar procedure at their home institutes.

<!-- ## What are Molecular Dynamics? -->
<!-- [Molecular -->
<!-- dynamics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Molecular_Simulation/Molecular_Dynamics) -->
<!-- simulations are a tool to simulate the motions of atoms of a many-body system. -->
<!-- Molecular dynamics may be used to compute the equilibrium and transport -->
<!-- properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, diffusion, reaction rate, protein -->
<!-- folding time, structure and surface coating) of a classical system. To simulate -->
<!-- the dynamics of molecules, classical Newtonian mechanics can be used. In -->
<!-- practice, molecular dynamics simulations are performed by moving in small -->
<!-- increments of time. It is the solution of the classical equations of motion for -->
<!-- atoms and molecules to obtain the evolution of a system. Because molecular -->
<!-- systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to -->
<!-- determine the properties of such complex systems analytically, so MD is applied -->
<!-- to these systems to solve this problem by using numerical methods. -->
