# About FunMolSim 2019

The objective of this workshop is to expose the students and researchers to
various molecular simulation techniques with special emphasis on engineering
applications. The school particularly is targeted for graduate students,
post-doctoral students, young lecturers and assistant professors. The lectures
will enable the participants to learn the fundamental concepts of molecular
simulations and its applications to solve a wide range of engineering problems.

<!-- ## What are Molecular Dynamics? -->
<!-- [Molecular -->
<!-- dynamics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Molecular_Simulation/Molecular_Dynamics) -->
<!-- simulations are a tool to simulate the motions of atoms of a many-body system. -->
<!-- Molecular dynamics may be used to compute the equilibrium and transport -->
<!-- properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, diffusion, reaction rate, protein -->
<!-- folding time, structure and surface coating) of a classical system. To simulate -->
<!-- the dynamics of molecules, classical Newtonian mechanics can be used. In -->
<!-- practice, molecular dynamics simulations are performed by moving in small -->
<!-- increments of time. It is the solution of the classical equations of motion for -->
<!-- atoms and molecules to obtain the evolution of a system. Because molecular -->
<!-- systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to -->
<!-- determine the properties of such complex systems analytically, so MD is applied -->
<!-- to these systems to solve this problem by using numerical methods. -->

<!-- Molecular simulations are a powerful tool to investigate the thermodynamic and -->
<!-- transport properties of a variety of systems. A wide class of scientific -->
<!-- phenomena can be explored and understood from a molecular level. This is also -->
<!-- reflected in the increased number of publications in this area, by many folds, -->
<!-- in recent years. The advances in the computing technology, on the other hand, -->
<!-- have also enabled us to solve a wide range of complex problems. -->
